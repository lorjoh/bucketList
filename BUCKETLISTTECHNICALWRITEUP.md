# 'Bucket List' National Parks App
# Technical Description

## App by the ParkPlace team: Sandra Ayika, Doug Davidoff, and Frank Salvo

### Description
"Bucket List" aids travelers in planning and executing visits to 500 U.S. National Park Service properties. The app presents users with activities and topics featured at each property, and allows users to record their desires and plans.

### Motivation
"Bucket List" is an online re-interpretation of a workbook by the same name published by My Bucket Journals. We use exceptional photography and an information database provided by NPS to present options to the user.

### Results
"Bucket List" is in a demonstration phase. It is working functionality, but it also is ready for near-term enhancements to bolster the user experience.

### Development Team Efforts
The ParkPlace team used a classic front-end vs. back-end division of labor.
##### Sandra Ayika
Sandra was responsible for creating two of the three major front-end pages.
##### Doug Davidoff
Doug was responsible for one of the three major front-end pages and assisted with data capture for storage to the Bucket List database.
##### Frank Salvo
Frank was responsible for overall data integration, APIs, the MVC, and templates.
##### Challenges
All three ParkPlace developers are behind in their coding bootcamp studies. This turned "Bucket List" into quite a hands-on learning experience. The database was most difficult, followed by uploading to Heroku. GitHub presented use challenges for all parties.

### Improvements Road Map
The following near-term improvements will greatly enhance the usefulness of "Bucket List" by ParkPlace:
1. Use of a carousel to display the five beautiful pictures provided by the NPS database for each NPS property.
1. User authentication using Passport or similar to allow multiple users to explore and save their Bucket Lists independently and securely.
1. Using SendGrid or similar to email the Bucket List to the user or to friends.
1. Add additional functionality inspired by the extensive topics in the "Bucket List" spiral-bound notebook and journal.
