### Project Description
 "Bucket List" aids travelers in planning and executing visits to 500 U.S. National Park Service properties. The app presents users with activities and topics featured at each property, and allows users to record their desires and plans.

 ![Our inspiration, the "National Parks Bucket Journal," published by My Bucket Journals of Texas](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10477863/99752348-28ae7800-2ab2-11eb-9dde-135b4f3b7ab6.png)
 
### Installation
 The applications runs from a web server. No local installation is necessary. To access the site, visit this URL: URL_GOES_HERE.
### Usage
 The user arrives first at the "Explore" page. Here, the user may explore the 500 National Park Service properties by name, or by choosing activities or topics the user would like to pursue at a park. Working through this rubric, the user selects a park for greater attention and arrives at the "Focus" page. Here the user is presented with more details about the park as well as beautiful photography by National Park Service photographers. The user is able to record information about their plans for visiting the park, and the information is stored in a cloud database. Finally, on the "Bucket List" page, the user can review the information they have recorded.

### Future Development
 Near-term improvements will greatly enhance the usefulness of "Bucket List" by ParkPlace. Among these improvements are: (a) use of a carousel to display the five beautiful pictures provided by the NPS database for each NPS property, (b) user authentication using Passport or similar to allow multiple users to explore and save their Bucket Lists independently and securely, (c) using SendGrid or similar to email the user's Bucket List to the user or to friends, and (d) add additional functionality inspired by the extensive topics in the "National Parks Bucket List" spiral-bound journal and notebook published by My Bucket Journals, a small family-owned company which is not affiliated with the ParkPlace team but nonetheless provided the inspiration for this app.
